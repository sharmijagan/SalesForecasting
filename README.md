# SalesForecasting

Problem Statement:
Rossmann is a European drug distributor which operates over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. Since a lot of drugs come with a short shelf life, that is, they do not have a long expiry date, it becomes imperative for Rossmann to accurately forecast sales at their individual stores. Currently, the forecasting is taken care of by the store managers who are tasked with forecasting daily sales for the next six weeks. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotional campaigns, competition, state holidays, seasonality, and locality.

With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances and intuitions, the accuracy of the forecasts is quite varied. To overcome this problem, we have to build a model to forecast the daily sales for the next six weeks.you have been provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. Since the company is just embarking on this project, the scope has been kept to nine key stores across Europe and the stores are numbered - 1,3,8,9,13,25,29,31 and 46.

My Approach:
The main aim of the notebook is to predict Sales price of various Store Types of Rossman. The Dataset consists of various factors such as number of customers for each store,no of 1st promotion offered by the store,Number of Stores that offer 2nd promotion followed by 1st promotion,Effect of Sales due to School& State Holiday,distance of Competition Stores from the current store that effect the Sales of the store.

Steps:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Building
